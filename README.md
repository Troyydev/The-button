# 🎲 The Button

**A chaotic and delightful experiment in randomness. Press the button and prepare for anything.**

## 🧪 What is this?

**The Button** is a playful HTML project that does something *different* every time you press it. It could be:

- A color explosion 🌈  
- A mini-game 🎯  
- Confetti everywhere 🎉  
- Random websites opening 🌐  
- Modals popping up 📢  
- Particles, shapes, beeps, and madness! 💥  

Every press is a surprise. You’ll never know what happens next.

## 🚀 Live Demo

Coming soon (or host it yourself)!
